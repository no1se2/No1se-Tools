# No1se-Tools
This is a Bash script that provides a user interface for accessing and running various tools created by a user named no1se. The script greets the user by asking for their name and then displays a menu of available tools, including No1seCamTool, NO1SE-MASK, No1se-phishing-Tool, and others. The user can select a tool from the menu, and the script will automatically clone the tool's repository from GitHub and run the tool's main script. The script also uses escape sequences to add color to the command-line interface, making the menu and messages easier to read.
